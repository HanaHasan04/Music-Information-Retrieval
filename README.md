# Music Information Retrieval (MIR)  
Driven by my amateurish interest in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), I've taken on the task of analyzing the structure of songs using their waveforms/spectrograms.  
  
I found this site https://musicinformationretrieval.com/ to be very helpful in understanding the fundamentals.  
   
   
I used the laplacian segmentation method of McFee and Ellis (https://brianmcfee.net/papers/ismir2014_spectral.pdf) for analyzing song structure with spectral clustering.
